My first webpage project :D
This is the recipes project, the final lesson in the intro to html section of the foundations course of 'The Odin Project'
In this section I have learned how to set up a basic website using html.
I have learned how to write basic html boilerplate; use various tags and elements to create text; link to other webpages both local and on the web and include images.
So far I am enjoying learning a new skill, though I need to spend more time becoming familiar with how to organise my directories and also all the git stuff.
Today I am experimenting with adding css to my website. I am practicing using the various devices i have learned in the css foundations section.
